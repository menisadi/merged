Tried to filter the data by the longest living cookie. 
For some reason got 0 instances.
Probably due to incorrect order of data filtering.
The process became a bit messy so I rebooted it and currenly rewriting the filtering pipline.

Finished writing LOTS (longest overlapping time-series).
Decided to not use it for now (to avoid comlications).
Added simple filter by longest living cookie (the reboot and change of filtering order seems to work).
A new bug appeared which made me realize that the non-random is sampled with replacement which is wrong.
Fixed and now the difference between the random and non-random is really small.
